# .env.local File Format
# Create a file named .env.local in the project root with the following format:

SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=design-requests
PORT=3000

# Instructions:
# 1. Get your Supabase URL and Service Role Key from:
#    https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api
# 2. Create a storage bucket named "design-requests" (or change the name above)
# 3. Make sure the bucket is set to public if you want public access to PDFs
# 4. Never commit .env.local to git - it contains sensitive credentials
